  In this paper, a novel multi-phase series capacitor trans-inductor voltage
  regulator (TLVR) with high frequency

  and fast dynamic response is proposed. The proposed voltage regulator combines the advantages of series capacitor buck converter and TLVR. The switching frequency can be improved a lot due to the reduced switching losses and doubled duty cycle. Moreover, the transient performance is enhanced with trans-inductor structure. The equivalent transient inductance is reduced remarkably without affecting steady-state performance. The proposed concept is validated by simulation and experiment. A significant dynamic performance improvement can be observed through the simulation results comparison.

abstract: In this article, a novel single-input–dual-output LLC converter is
  proposed for wide output voltage applications. An H5-bridge is utilized on the
  primary side and linked with two separate resonant tanks. By morphing the H5
  bridge, the input of each resonant tank can be configured as either
  full-bridge, half-bridge, or idle. On the secondary-side, two semiactive
  rectifiers provide two control degrees of freedoms. The circuit operation is
  always tuned at the optimal resonant frequency and the output voltages are
  modulated by the secondary side pulsewidth. It exhibits good voltage
  regulation performance with two fully decoupled output ports. Both output
  ports can achieve wide voltage ranges. All MOSFETs can achieve zero voltage
  switching turning- on and all the diodes can achieve zero current switching
  turning- off over a wide output voltage and load ranges. To verify this
  concept, a 1.6-kW rated prototype is designed to convert 390-V input into two
  decoupled 100–400 V outputs. The designed prototype exhibits 97.72% peak
  efficiency and good decoupled voltage regulation performances. The
  experimental results agree well with the theoretical analysis.

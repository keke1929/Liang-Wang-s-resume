abstract: In grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) generation systems, intelligent energy
  management is required to maximize its performance. In this article, a novel
  three-port energy router with optimized control is proposed for this
  application. The proposed converter can interface among three ports (PV
  source, battery, and dc-link) with high integration. The PV panel is connected
  to the battery through an interleaved boost structure on the primary side. The
  primary-side PV-battery system and secondary-side dc-link are connected
  through a dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter. The battery operates as an
  energy buffer to compensate for the power mismatch due to the intermittent
  nature of the PV source. According to the daily power profile and intelligent
  power management between the grid and battery, six operating modes are
  possible. Optimized control strategies are customized in different operating
  modes. The maximum-power-point-tracking (MPPT) of the PV panel can be always
  realized. The zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) condition for all mosfet s,
  reducing circulating current over a wide range, and flexible energy flow among
  three ports are all taken into considerations in the design. To verify the
  proposed concept, a 500 W rated prototype is designed. The designed prototype
  exhibits high efficiency in various operating modes. The experimental results
  agree well with the theoretical analysis.
